First Half-Line 1-112
No changes required

Second half-Line 113-252
Great! You've just shared the second section of your incident_template.html, which includes the full structure and static content of the IRP.

✅ Here’s what I found in this half:
✔️ Good:
Rich, well-organized content

Complete IRP structure: Executive Summary, Introduction, CSIRT Structure, Handling Phases

Sections are semantically correct (<h3>, <ul>, etc.)

🔍 What Needs Changing for Dynamic Mapping:
This template currently has static explanatory content. But your FastAPI backend is returning dynamic text blocks like:

{{ compliance_section }}

{{ csirt_section }}

{{ containment_section }}

{{ threat_response_section }}

So, to support dynamic mapping, you need to:

✅ Insert Dynamic Placeholders Where Needed
I suggest placing the dynamic blocks in these locations:

Template Section	Replace/Add This
After <h3>2.3 Incident Response Team Structure</h3>	Add {{ csirt_section }}
After <h2 id="handling-an-incident">Handling an Incident</h2>	Add {{ threat_response_section }}
After <h3>3.1 Preparation</h3> or new <h3>3.2 Containment</h3>	Add {{ containment_section }}
In a new section after "Appendix" or Compliance	Add {{ compliance_section }}

✨ How It Will Look in Template (Example):
html
Copy
Edit
<h3>2.3 Incident Response Team Structure</h3>
<p>{{ csirt_section }}</p>  <!-- dynamically generated team model -->

...

<h2 id="handling-an-incident">Handling an Incident</h2>
<p>The incident response process has several phases...</p>
<p>{{ threat_response_section }}</p> <!-- dynamically added ransomware/phishing/DDoS logic -->

...

<h3>3.2 Containment (Auto-generated)</h3>
<p>{{ containment_section }}</p>

...

<h3>Compliance Considerations</h3>
<p>{{ compliance_section }}</p>
✅ Summary of What to Do in This Section
Task	What to Do
✅ Insert {{ csirt_section }}	Under “2.3 Incident Response Team Structure”
✅ Insert {{ threat_response_section }}	In “Handling an Incident”
✅ Insert {{ containment_section }}	In Preparation or create new “Containment” section
✅ Insert {{ compliance_section }}	In new or existing Compliance section


Third Half-Line 253 to last
✅ Analysis of the Final (Third) Section
This section contains:

Preventive measures

Detection & analysis

Incident coordination

Appendices and glossary

Much of this is informational/static and doesn't need dynamic content injection. But to make your template work with your FastAPI + conditional mapping engine, we’ll make a few targeted insertions for the dynamic sections you've already defined in your main.py logic.

🔧 Final Integration Plan: What to Insert and Where

✅ Summary of All Edits (Insert These Tags):
Dynamic Key	Section Title	Where to Insert
{{ csirt_section }}	2.3 Incident Response Team Structure	After <h3>2.3 Incident Response Team Structure</h3>
{{ containment_section }}	3.1.3 Containment	After 3.1.2 (create new subsection)
{{ threat_response_section }}	3.3 Threat Response	Before "Coordination and Information Sharing" section
{{ compliance_section }}	1.5 Compliance	After Audience / End of Introduction section

📝 Optional Enhancements
Add a comment marker before each dynamic insertion, like:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- DYNAMIC INSERT: Threat Response Section -->
Helps with maintainability and future debugging.

If you want to make the document fully adaptable, you could also extract things like company_name, industry, etc. and insert those in appropriate places for branding.
