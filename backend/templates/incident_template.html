        <h2 id="organizing-a-csirc">Organizing a Computer Security Incident Response Capability</h2>
        <p>Organizing an effective computer security incident response capability (CSIRC) involves several major decisions and actions. One of the first considerations should be to create an organization-specific definition of the term “incident” so that the scope of the term is clear.</p>
        <p>The organization should decide what services the incident response team should provide, consider which team structures and models can provide those services, and select and implement one or more incident response teams. Incident response plan, policy, and procedure creation is an important part of establishing a team, so that incident response is performed effectively, efficiently, and consistently, and so that the team is empowered to do what needs to be done.</p>
        <p>This section provides guidelines for establishing incident response capabilities, and advice on maintaining and enhancing existing capabilities.</p>

        <h3>2.1 What is a computer security incident?</h3>
        <p>A computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.</p>
        <p>Examples of incidents are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An attacker commands a botnet to send high volumes of connection requests to a web server, causing it to crash.</li>
            <li>Users are tricked into opening a “quarterly report” sent via email that is actually malware.</li>
            <li>An attacker obtains sensitive data and threatens that the details will be released publicly.</li>
            <li>A user provides or exposes sensitive information to others through peer-to-peer file sharing services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Need for Incident Response</h3>
        <p>{{ csirt_section }}</p>

        <p>Attacks frequently compromise personal and business data. Incident response supports responding to incidents systematically, minimizing loss or theft of information and disruption of services.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Incident Response Team Structure</h3>
        <p>An incident response team should be available for anyone who discovers or suspects an incident. The team handles the incident, analyzes the data, determines the impact, and acts to limit the damage and restore normal services. The team’s success depends on the participation and cooperation of individuals throughout the organization.</p>
        
        <!-- ✅ INSERTED: CSIRT STRUCTURE -->
        <p>{{ csirt_section }}</p>

        <h4>2.3.1 Team Models</h4>
        <p>Possible structures for an incident response team include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Central Incident Response Team: A single team handles incidents throughout the organization.</li>
            <li>Distributed Incident Response Teams: Multiple teams, each responsible for a segment of the organization.</li>
            <li>Coordinating Team: An incident response team provides advice to other teams without having authority over those teams</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Incident response teams can also use any of three staffing models:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Employees: The organization performs all of its incident response work.</li>
            <li>Partially Outsourced: The organization outsources portions of its incident response work.</li>
            <li>Fully Outsourced: The organization completely outsources its incident response work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2.3.2 Team Model Selection</h4>
        <p>When selecting appropriate structure and staffing models, organizations should consider factors such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Need for 24/7 Availability.</li>
            <li>Full-Time Versus Part-Time Team Members.</li>
            <li>Employee Morale.</li>
            <li>Cost.</li>
             <li>Staff Expertise.</li>
            <li>Current and Future Quality of Work.</li>
            <li>Division of Responsibilities.</li>
            <li>Sensitive Information Revealed to the Contractor.</li>
            <li>Lack of Organization-Specific Knowledge.</li>
            <li>Lack of Correlation.</li>
            <li>Handling Incidents at Multiple Locations.</li>
            <li>Maintaining Incident Response Skills In-House</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2.3.3 Incident Response Personnel</h4>
        <p>A single employee, with one or more designated alternates, should be in charge of incident response. The managers typically perform a variety of tasks, including acting as a liaison with upper management and other teams and organizations, defusing crisis situations, and ensuring that the team has the necessary personnel, resources, and skills.
        </p>
        <p>Team members should have excellent technical skills (e.g., system administration, network administration) and problem-solving skills. It is helpful to have some team members specialize in particular technical areas, such as network intrusion detection, malware analysis, or forensics.</p>
        <p>Incident response team members should also have teamwork and communication skills.</p>

        <h4>2.3.4 Incident Response Team Services</h4>
        <p>The main focus of an incident response team is performing incident response. Other services a team might offer include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Intrusion Detection.</li>
            <li>Advisory Distribution.</li>
            <li>Education and Awareness.</li>
            <li>Information Sharing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="handling-an-incident">Handling an Incident</h2>
        <p>The incident response process has several phases: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity.</p>
        <p>Figure 3-1 illustrates the incident response life cycle.</p>
        <h3>3.1 Preparation</h3>
        <p>Incident response methodologies emphasize preparation—establishing an incident response capability and preventing incidents.</p>

        <h4>3.1.1 Preparing to Handle Incidents</h4>

        <p>{{ containment_section }}</p>
        <p>Keeping the number of incidents reasonably low is very important to protect the business processes of the organization. If security controls are insufficient, higher volumes of incidents may occur, overwhelming the incident response team.</p>
        <p>Some of the main recommended practices for securing networks, systems, and applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Risk Assessments.</li>
            <li>Host Security.</li>
            <li>Network Security.</li>
            <li>Malware Prevention.</li>
            <li>User Awareness and Training.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="detection-and-analysis">Detection and Analysis</h2>
        <h3>3.2.1 Attack Vectors</h3>
        <p>Organizations should be generally prepared to handle any incident but should focus on being prepared to handle incidents that use common attack vectors. Common attack vectors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>External/Removable Media</li>
            <li>Attrition</li>
            <li>Web</li>
            <li>Email</li>
            <li>Impersonation</li>
            <li>Improper Usage</li>
             <li>Loss or Theft of Equipment</li>
            <li>Other</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2.2 Signs of an Incident</h3>
        <p>For many organizations, the most challenging part of the incident response process is accurately detecting and assessing possible incidents.</p>
        <p>Common indicators of an attack include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web server log entries that show the usage of a vulnerability scanner</li>
            <li>An announcement of a new exploit</li>
            <li>A threat from a group stating that the group will attack the organization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of indicators are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A network intrusion detection sensor alerts.</li>
            <li>Antivirus software alerts.</li>
            <li>A system administrator sees a filename with unusual characters.</li>
            <li>A host records an auditing configuration change in its log.</li>
            <li>An application logs multiple failed login attempts.</li>
            <li>An email administrator sees a large number of bounced emails with suspicious content</li>
            <li>A network administrator notices an unusual deviation from typical network traffic flows.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2.3 Incident Analysis</h3>
        <p>Each indicator should be evaluated to determine if it is legitimate. The following are recommendations for making incident analysis easier and more effective:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Profile Networks and Systems.</li>
            <li>Understand Normal Behaviors.</li>
            <li>Create a Log Retention Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>{{ threat_response_section }}</p>


        <h2 id="coordination-and-information-sharing">Coordination and Information Sharing</h2>
        <h3>Coordination</h3>
        <p>The incident response team needs to coordinate its activities with other groups, both inside and outside the organization.Here are some of the parties within the organization with whom the incident response team may interact:
        </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Senior management</li>
            <li>Legal department</li>
            <li>Public relations</li>
            <li>Internal audit</li>
            <li>Physical security personnel</li>
            <li>Human resources</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Information Sharing Techniques</h3>
        <p>Sharing incident-related information with other organizations can be beneficial. Common techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ad Hoc</li>
            <li>Partially Automated</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
        <p>Organizations should consider the following security issues when sharing incident-related information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Granular Information Sharing</li>
            <li>Business Impact Information</li>
            <li>Technical Information</li>
        </ul>
